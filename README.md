# boobcraft (working title!!)

simple 3D engine written in C + OpenGL

3DS vibes

Making a 3D game (moreso engine...) like it's 1998(ish). Minimal and lightweight with no static dependencies. Trying to use only snake case and failing.

im not adding multiplayer. I might also fix the resolution at 400x240 we'll see :3
