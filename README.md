# boobcraft (working title!!)

simple 3D engine written in C + OpenGL

3DS vibes. or HL vibes idk

Making a 3D game (moreso engine...) like it's 1998(ish). Minimal and lightweight with no static dependencies. Trying to use only snake case and failing.

im not adding multiplayer

I'll need to make a header file for all the "implement these" parts of the game engine (abstraction yay). including for informing resource incorperation...

GLEW is installed and compiled as part of the program, but the other libraries (OpenGL, SDL2) must be present on your machine already.

| Specs      |         |
|------------|---------|
| Resolution | 400x240 |
| Framerate  | 30fps   |
